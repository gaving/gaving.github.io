From [what is this Devops thing anyway?](http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/)

> On most projects I’ve worked on, the project team is split into developers,
> testers, release managers and sysadmins working in separate silos. From a
> process perspective this is dreadfully wasteful. It can also lead to a 'lob it
> over the wall' philosophy - problems are passed between business analysts,
> developers, QA specialists and sysadmins. Furthermore, we see a replication of
> this silo structure within the teams - it’s not uncommon to see dedicated
> database and network people in the same system team, alongside sysadmins. Often
> the larger silos aren't in the same office, the same city, or in sometimes not
> even in the same country. The result is an ‘us and them’ mentality - groups of
> people who are simultaneously suspicious of and afraid of each other.
