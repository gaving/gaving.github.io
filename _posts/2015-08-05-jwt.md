### JWT

> Basically, the token (JWT) is the simplest structure that you will deal with
> while implementing JOSE in our architecture; it is a string representation of
> some data base64 encoded (other types of encoding might be applied, but this
> is not madatory): the JWT differs from raw base64-encoded data since it also
> includes informations about the encoding itself, in the tokenâ€™s header; by
> concatenating the base64-encoded version of the token header and payload (the
> actual data) you obtain what the specification calls signature input, which
> will then be used to create the signature (JWS).

### JWS and JWE

> After the JWT comes the JWS, which is a signed representation of the JWT; it
> differs from the token just because of the signature; on an higher step of the
> ladder comes the JWE instead, which lets you encrypt the data in order to
> achieve an higher security level: the examples in the ietf draft show you how
> to create JWEs with a pair of private / public keys.
