> On December 7, 1972, the rock-and-roll magazine Rolling Stone, not Popular
> Election-les, published an article about the scientists at Xerox PARC,
> complete with photographs by Annie Lcibovitx.

> When the senior board members of Xerox saw their employees out west revealed
> to the world as wild hippies lying around labs that looked like college dorm
> rooms, they just about died of shock. Generations since then have grown up
> accustomed to the casual climate of the modern high-tech office. But for the
> corporate community of 1970, this permissiveness was all still quite
> unorthodox.

> What the directors of PARC were trying to accomplish with this work
> environment was to get their people to loosen up their expectations and think
> outside of the box about just what a computer was capable of. They didn't
> just want computers to be smart. They wanted computers to be fun. And the
> first thing to do was to have fun, knock the computers around, and try to
> make them do things they were not built to do.
